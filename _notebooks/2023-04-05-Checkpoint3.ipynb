    "* Analyze the Big O complexity on Sorts.\n",
    "  * Establish analytics including:time to sort, number of comparisons and number of swaps.\n",
    "  * Average the results for each each Sort, run each at least 12 times and 5000 elements. \n",
    "  * You should throw out High and Low when doing analysis.\n",
    "  * Make your final/judgement on best sort: Number of Comparisons, Number of Swaps, Big O complexity, and Total Time.\n",
    "* Build your own Hashmap. Make a HashMap to correspond to a Data Structure using a Collection.\n",
    "  * Be sure to have 5000 records\n",
    "  * Perform analysis on Binary Search vs HashMap Lookup, try using random to search and find 100 keys in 5000 records. Perform 12 times and throw out high and low.\n",
    "* Extra, Practical learning\n",
    "  * Performing Iteration, Delete, and Add operations are another way to analyze Collection vs HashMap data structure.\n",
    "  * A HashMap and a Collection can be used in a Class, POJO and API.\n",
    "  * Make a Diagram on the Pros and Cons of Collection vs HashMap"
