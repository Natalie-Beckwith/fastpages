    "\n",
    "C is incorrect because `{17, 37, 21, 42, 18, 69, 48, 28, 39}` would be the result if the code segment in the for loop was changed to `numbers[k] = numbers[k] + 3`.\n",
    "\n",
    "A is the correct answer because the values of the loop control variable `k` starts at `1` and is incremented by `3` as long as `k` is less than `numbers.length`. As a result, `k` will have the values `1`, `4`, `7` and then when it becomes `10`, the loop will end. Only the values in `numbers` at indexes `1`, `4`, and `7` will be updated to the value of the sum of the element at the index that is one less than `k` (the element before the one being updated) and `3`. So, `numbers[1]` will be assigned the value of `numbers[0] + 3` or `20`, `numbers[4]` will be assigned the value of `numbers[3] + 3` or `45`, and `numbers[7]` will be assigned the value of `numbers[6] + 3` or `51`. All other values will be unchanged.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 18)\n",
    "\n",
    "E is incorrect because this would be the result if the division used was floating point division instead of integer division and the result was cast to an int, as in `(int)(404.0 / 10 * 10 + 1)`.\n",
    "\n",
    "D is the correct answer because the first operation that is executed is `404 / 10`. Since both `404` and `10` are integers, integer division is used resulting in `40`. The value `40` is then multiplied by `10`, resulting in `400`, and finally `1` is added, meaning `401` is printed.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 29)\n",
    "\n",
    "D is incorrect because the value `1` is only returned when `num` is a single digit number.\n",
    "\n",
    "A is the correct answer because each recursive call is made with the value `num  / 10`. The expression `num / 10` uses integer division and evaluates to an integer that is `num` with the right most digit removed. For example, `258 / 10 = 25`. Each time the recursive call is made, what is returned is `1` plus the result of the recursive call. For example, `what(258) = 1 + what(25)` and `what(25) = 1 + what(2)` and `what(2) = 1`. Therefore `what(258) = 1 + 1 + 1` or `3`, which is the number of digits in `258`.\n",

    "### Small Code Excercises\n",
    "* Write a Jupyter notebook on the primitive data types. Use `array` and methods like `substring` and `random` as applicable: `int`, `double`, `boolean`, `char`\n",
    "* Next, convert each of the examples to corresponding Wrapper classes, using arrays\n",

    "\n",
    "#### Methods\n",
    "* A **method** is a block of code which only runs when it's called\n",
    "  * **Parameters**, or data can be passed into a method\n",
    "* Methods are used to perform certain actions. Another word for them is a **function**\n",
    "* See more information on methods [here](https://www.w3schools.com/java/java_methods.asp)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Control Structures\n",
    "* **Control structure** are blocks of code that can change the path of execution. There are 3 kinds of control structures:\n",
    "  1.  **Condiditional Branches** - used for choosing between 2+ paths (`if/else` statements)\n",
    "  2.  **Loops** - used it iterate through multiple values/objects and repeatedly run specific code blocks (`for`, `while`, and `do while` loops)\n",
    "  3.  **Branching Statements** - used to break the flow of control in loops (`break` and `continue`)\n",
    "* See more information on control structures [here](https://www.baeldung.com/java-control-structures)\n",

    "#### Teacher's Code Examples\n",

    "##### `DiverseArray` Example\n",
    "* Methods?\n",
    "  * Yes, `DiverseArray` does contain methods. Examples of this are: `arraySum()`, `rowSums()`, and `isDiverse()`.\n",
    "* Control Structures?\n",
    "  * Yes, `DiverseArray` does contain control stuctures. There are examples of `for` loops and `if` statements.\n",
    "* Fit data types?\n",
    "  * Yes, `DiverseArray` has data types of `int` and `boolean`. It also has `int[]` and `int[][]`.\n",

    "  * \n",
    "* What does `IntByReference` do?\n",
    "  * \n",
    "\n",
    "##### `Menu` Example\n",
    "* Find a way to make `Menu` work on a Jupyter Notebook.\n",
    "  * View code [here]()\n",
    "* Are instances of `MenuRow` and `Runnable` data types, control structures?\n",
    "  * \n",
    "* Does Driver have control structures? If so, list all the control Structures.\n",

    "## College Board FRQ\n",
    "\n",
    "* Look at 1 unique FRQ per pair/treo on AP Classroom that goes over Methods and Control Structures\n",
    "* Provide teacher a Jupyter Notebook, Video, and/or Code that cover key concepts\n",
    "  * Make this better than AP Classroom, specifically trying to get these reviews to cover key parts in under Five minutes\n",
    "  * This option could use your PBL project and concepts if they were tailored to Teaching.\n",
    "* Explore Testing requirements in AP Classroom Video\n",
    "* Explore AP FRQ that teaches us about Methods and Control Structures FRQ, 18:10\n",
    "* Make sure that code runs completely, complete any portion of FRQ that is undone. Complete FRQs in a Jupyter notebook with markdown description and comments is a requirement\n",
    "* Integrate Data Types into the discussion as this is import concept when studying early materials\n",
    "* Integrate Definition of Methods and Control Structures in comments and definitions.\n",
