    "#### 13)\n",
    "\n",
    "C is incorrect because `{17, 37, 21, 42, 18, 69, 48, 28, 39}` would be the result if the code segment in the for loop was changed to `numbers[k] = numbers[k] + 3`.\n",
    "\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "A is the correct answer because the values of the loop control variable `k` starts at `1` and is incremented by `3` as long as `k` is less than `numbers.length`. As a result, `k` will have the values `1`, `4`, `7` and then when it becomes `10`, the loop will end. Only the values in `numbers` at indexes `1`, `4`, and `7` will be updated to the value of the sum of the element at the index that is one less than `k` (the element before the one being updated) and `3`. So, `numbers[1]` will be assigned the value of `numbers[0] + 3` or `20`, `numbers[4]` will be assigned the value of `numbers[3] + 3` or `45`, and `numbers[7]` will be assigned the value of `numbers[6] + 3` or `51`. All other values will be unchanged.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 18)\n",
    "\n",
    "E is incorrect because this would be the result if the division used was floating point division instead of integer division and the result was cast to an int, as in `(int)(404.0 / 10 * 10 + 1)`.\n",
    "\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "D is the correct answer because the first operation that is executed is `404 / 10`. Since both `404` and `10` are integers, integer division is used resulting in `40`. The value `40` is then multiplied by `10`, resulting in `400`, and finally `1` is added, meaning `401` is printed.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 29)\n",
    "\n",
    "D is incorrect because the value `1` is only returned when `num` is a single digit number.\n",
    "\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "A is the correct answer because each recursive call is made with the value `num  / 10`. The expression `num / 10` uses integer division and evaluates to an integer that is `num` with the right most digit removed. For example, `258 / 10 = 25`. Each time the recursive call is made, what is returned is `1` plus the result of the recursive call. For example, `what(258) = 1 + what(25)` and `what(25) = 1 + what(2)` and `what(2) = 1`. Therefore `what(258) = 1 + 1 + 1` or `3`, which is the number of digits in `258`.\n",

    "## Instructions\n",
    "\n",
    "### Early Seed\n",
    "* Write a sample binary addition 1 + 1 = 10\n",
    "* Have Java Code cell on screen at start of lecture\n",
    "\n",
    "### Small Code Excercises\n",
    "* Write a Jupyter notebook on the primitive data types\n",
    "Write a Jupyter notebook code example on the following primitive types with a code example (4 to 5 lines)\n",
    "  * preference would be using `array` and methods like `substring` and `random` as applicable: `int`, `double`, `boolean`, `char`\n",
    "* Now convert each of the examples to corresponding Wrapper classes, using arrays\n",
    "  * expression of these in Class or PBL forms is an option. But the review must be easy for me to see work\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Concepts\n",
    "* Make a Jupyter Notebook that goes over key concepts in Teacher code and uses background from ChatGPT and from AP Classroom.\n",
    "  * What are Methods and Control Structures? (See College Board)\n",
    "  \n",
    "  <br>\n",
    "  \n",
    "  * Look at `Diverse Arrays` and `Matrix` in Teacher's code. Do they have Methods and Control structures?\n",
    "  * Look at `Diverse Arrays` and `Matrix` in Teacher's code. Do they fit the data types?\n",
    "  * `Math.random` is covered in `Number`, this Teacher code associated with random is critical knowledge when taking the AP Exam. Random numbers in range like 7 to 9 is very important.\n",
    "  * What does `DoNothingByValue` do?\n",
    "  * What does `IntByReference` do?\n",
    "\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Review `Menu` code. `Try`, `Catch`, and `Runnable` are used to control program execution. Find a way to make `Menu` work on a Jupyter Notebook.\n",
    "  * Are instances of `MenuRow` and `Runnable` data types, control structures?\n",
    "  * Does Driver have control structures? If so, list all the control Structures.\n",
