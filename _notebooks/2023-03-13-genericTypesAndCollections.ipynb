    "\n",
    "#### Access Modifier\n",
    "* Keywords that can be used to control the visibility of fields, methods, and constructors in a class. Examples include:\n",
    "  * `public` - We can access the modifier anywhere, this includes inside and outside the class as well as inside and outside the package.\n",
    "  * `protected` - We can access the modifier within the same package and also from outside the package with the help of a child class. If we do not make a child class, then the modifier cannot be accessed outside the package.\n",
    "  * `default` - We can only access the modifier within the same package. If we do not specify any access modifier, it will automatically have a default modifier.\n",
    "  * `private` - We can access the modifier only within the same class.\n",
    "\n",
    "![img](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/cdn-uploads/Access-Modifiers-in-Java.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "See more information [here](https://www.mygreatlearning.com/blog/the-access-modifiers-in-java/)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Constructor\n",
    "* A special method that is used to initialize objects\n",
    "* The constructor is called when the an object of a class is created\n",
    "\n",
    "See more information [here](https://www.w3schools.com/java/java_constructors.asp)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Setters & Getters\n",
    "* **Get** methods return the variable value\n",
    "* **Set** methods sets the value\n",
    "* Both are used to protect your data, particularly when creating classes\n",
