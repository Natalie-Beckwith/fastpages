# TPT Notes:

## Week 4 - 9/13 Notes:
### Iteration with 2D Arrays:
* Recreate monkey program
* Tic-Tac-Toe

## Java Spring/Thymeleaf:
* cache - the process of storing things locally
* Deployment --> put server into 
   * Default for Java: 80:80
   * Changed to prevent clashing
   * Changed to 80:85
* **CODE CODE CODE:**
   * Spending too much money on Amazon :((
   * Delete all of instances on AWS
   * Make 1 instance per team
   * 8G --> whole team won't fit
   * Figure out how to pick a port
   * Use 80:85
* Index is automatically named by Java
* Greet --> type in name and computer says hello

### Human Day:
* Agile - grows and develops
* Avoids methodology
* Adapt to certain problems
* Use a SCRUM board
   * Live review --> product demo
* Extreme programming
   * Pair-programming
* Test Driven Development - test towards criteria
* Small details or broad details
*

## Week 3 - 9/7 Notes:
### Boolean Expressions and If Statements:
* Boolean - logical statement that can be evaluated to the values true/false
* EX: ``` if (true) { System.out.println("True code block"); } ```
* LOGICAL OPERATORS
  * && - and
  * || - or
  * ! - not
* Parenthesis matter
* De Morgan's Law
   * (A ∪ B)' = A' ∩ B'
   * "The complement of the union of the two sets A and B will be equal to the intersection of A' (complement of A) and B' (complement of B)."
   * EX: ```!((false || !true) || (false && true))```

## PBL Tip: have the least amount of logical operators as possible

* Hacks:
* Build your own Jupyter Notebook lesson on ifs
   * Explain if, if-else, and if-elseif-else.
   * Make a markdown block before you sample code
   * Comment in code to describe each decision
* Add to lesson switch-case
   * Create and if-elseif-elseif-elsif-else statement, 5 or more conditions.
   * Covert the 5 or more decisions to a switch-case-case-case-case-otherwise.
   * Make a markdown block before each code example
   * Comment/establish a style of comments for your if-elseif and switch-case code blocks
* Finish lesson with De Morgan's law
   * Describe De Morgan's law
   * Illustrate De Morgan's law
   * Show some code running that shows understanding
   * Resources, it is really time to show you can find resources beyond the Teacher
   * Code/Code/Coding is everywhere, find something that helps

## Week 2 - 8/30 Notes:
* Java can create objects with..
   * Scanner Class - inputs/outputs
   * System Class - output to console using static method ```System.out.printf()```
   * Math Class - call a static method ```Math.random()```
* Other College Board Topics:
* 2D Array to store colors
   * x --> color; y --> color code
* Control Structure - used to process a Menu

### Front-end
* Fastpages is front-end
   * Runs in browser
   * HTML & CSS
   * No server to run on
* GitHub Pages are also front-end
* ***Find a theme that works other than Minima on fastpages***
* Challenge: take Liquid/JavaScript and see if you can build Mr. M's schedule
* Do a time-box of your own schedule

### Human Day
* must do for review (or else -0.25 to score)
   * review score at top of review ticket
   * link to fastpages
   * tickets are with 4 person group

## Week 1 - 8/23 Notes:
* Python - weakly type language
* Java - strongly type language

* In Java, you have to declare data types
* In Python it automatically changes data types
* Java is OOP

* Primitive Data Types
   * Boolean
   * Character
   * Integer
   * Double/Float
   * Long
   * Short
   * 

* Non-Primitive: (classes)
    * String
    * Array
    * etc.

* Wrapper class - contains methods (functions)

* Opening notebook - vs code > apcsa repo > notebooks directory
