    "The given method increases each element of the array numbers by 1. Code segment I does not work as intended. It assigns num a copy of each element of numbers. When num is incremented, it does not change the corresponding value stored in numbers.\n",

    "In order to apply De Morganâ€™s laws and negate the condition in the if statement in the given code segment, the logical operator should be changed from || to &&. As an example, if a, b, c, and d have the values 1, 2, 2, and 2, respectively, then the given code segment would print \"dog\" and this code segment would print \"cat\".\n",
