The code segment uses an enhanced for loop to traverse the valueList array. The statement inside the loop calls the getNum method to access the num instance variable. Option III is incorrect.

    "This image would require the second set of nested loops to initialize `row` to `val – 1`, increment both `row` and `col` in each iteration inner loop (instead of `row` being decremented) and changing the condition on the inner loop to `col < 5 && row < 5`.\n",

    "The first set of nested for loops sets each element in board to “O”. The next for loop starts val at 0 and increments by `1` until `val` is `4`, when `val` is `5` the loop terminates. When `val` is even, `board` is not updated, so nothing happens when `val` is `0`. When `val` is `1`, `row` is assigned `1` and `col` is assigned `0`. The boolean condition in the while loop is `true`, so `board[1][0]` is assigned `“X”`. Then `col` is incremented to `1` and `row` is decremented to `0` and `board[0][1]` is assigned `“X”`. Then `col` is incremented to `2` and `row` is decremented to `-1` and the while loop terminates. When `val` is `2`, nothing changes about `board`. When `val` is `3`, `row` is assigned `3` and `col` is assigned `0`. The boolean condition in the while loop is `true`, so `board[3][0]` is assigned `“X”`. Then `col` is incremented to `1` and `row` is decremented to `2` and `board[2][1]` is assigned `“X”`. Then `col` is incremented to `2` and `row` is decremented to `1` and `board[1][2]` is assigned `“X”`. Then `col` is incremented to `3` and `row` is decremented to `0` and `board[0][3]` is assigned `“X”`. Finally, `col` is incremented to `4` and `row` is decremented to `-1` and the while loop terminates. When `val` is `4`, nothing changes about `board`."
