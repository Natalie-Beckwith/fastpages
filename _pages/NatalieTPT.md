## Week 7 - 10/4 Notes
* Fetch --> JavaScript
* Different ways to process an API
* Every attribute --> 1 setter and 1 getter
  * 4 attributes --> constructor has 4 attributes
* Postman: git --> put --> tool for backend

### ArrayLists
* Uses generic data types
* Defined in ```< >```
* Enter any **object** into "```ArrayList```"

### Extends/Implements
* Use extends as an alternate way to copy/paste

### Jokes
* Deployment:
   * AWS
* POJO (**P**lain **O**ld **J**ava **O**bject)
   * Simple --> ex: class, methods(functions), and attributes(varibles/arguments)
* Setters --> set values to attributes
* Constructors are automattically made
* Zero argument constructor --> ```public ClassName()```
* All argument constructor:<br>
```public ClassName()```<br>
```{```<br>
```this.attributes = attributes;```<br>
```}```<br>
* Code first database --> build an entity with and SQL database
* CRUD (**C**reate **R**ead **U**pdate **D**elete)
* ```init()``` --> runs independently

#### TO-DO
* ArrayLists
* Frontend/Backend
* Integration w/ crossover team about project
* Create a poster for the classroom
* Work on College Board Presentations (Arrays)
* 

-----
## Week 6 - 9/27 Notes

* Points:
  * Friday --> closing gradebook, fix issues w/ points by Friday
* Images for Java
* Rapid API
* Review for project
* Interest by each individual

* Make abstract class: define init() for extending
* you do not inherit constructors
  * must use ```super()```
* Telescoping - one constructor goes into another constructor
* polymorphic behavior --> two methods that the same name, but one has it's own instances, and the other does not
* Override --> doesn't need but prefer to see
* User can see clearly that the class is extended
* Protected --> only inherited classes can access
* Public --> can access it in other classes
* Private --> cannot access outside class

* **Minimize lines of code >:)))**
* For loop with arrays:
* each element is assigned to 2 values (0 & 1)
* decrement operator: ```--```
* change ```super()``` name

-----

## Week 5 - 9/20 Notes

* Try to abstract init()
* @Override init()
* Hacks --> while loop, recursion, see comments in code

### JavaScript Tutorial

* Goal this week: Design
* JavaScript VS Java --> marketing
  * Syntax is a little similar to Java
* JSON

### Program Design

* Data & Visual
* Pick something that everyone in the group is interested in
* Have code base --> brainstorm what you are going to use
* UML, how to separate things to-do into parts for each person to do
* Think about key technical algorithmic problems
* Testing --> debugging, unit testing, main method
  * Without testing methods, code will break

#### Teacher Ideas

* redo college board
  * Redo it for different AP classes
  * Way for you to study
* Classroom management
  * Databases
  * Finding GitHub usernames and repos

#### Project Plan

* Find project plan by next week
* Frontend & Backend
  * Visuals
  * Java
* Add arrays + arrayLists

-----

## Week 4 - 9/13 Notes

### Iteration with 2D Arrays

* Recreate monkey program
* Tic-Tac-Toe

## Java Spring/Thymeleaf

* cache - the process of storing things locally
* Deployment --> put server into
  * Default for Java: 80:80
  * Changed to prevent clashing
  * Changed to 80:85
* **CODE CODE CODE:**
  * Spending too much money on Amazon :((
  * Delete all of instances on AWS
  * Make 1 instance per team
  * 8G --> whole team won't fit
  * Figure out how to pick a port
  * Use 80:85
* Index is automatically named by Java
* Greet --> type in name and computer says hello

### Human Day 2

* Agile - grows and develops
* Avoids methodology
* Adapt to certain problems
* Use a SCRUM board
  * Live review --> product demo
* Extreme programming
  * Pair-programming
* Test Driven Development - test towards criteria
* Small details or broad details

-----

## Week 3 - 9/7 Notes

### Boolean Expressions and If Statements

* Boolean - logical statement that can be evaluated to the values true/false
* EX: ``` if (true) { System.out.println("True code block"); } ```
* LOGICAL OPERATORS
  * && - and
  * || - or
  * ! - not
* Parenthesis matter
* De Morgan's Law
  * (A ∪ B)' = A' ∩ B'
  * "The complement of the union of the two sets A and B will be equal to the intersection of A' (complement of A) and B' (complement of B)."
  * EX: ```!((false || !true) || (false && true))```

## PBL Tip: have the least amount of logical operators as possible

* Hacks:
* Build your own Jupyter Notebook lesson on ifs
  * Explain if, if-else, and if-elseif-else.
  * Make a markdown block before you sample code
  * Comment in code to describe each decision
* Add to lesson switch-case
  * Create and if-elseif-elseif-elsif-else statement, 5 or more conditions.
  * Covert the 5 or more decisions to a switch-case-case-case-case-otherwise.
  * Make a markdown block before each code example
  * Comment/establish a style of comments for your if-elseif and switch-case code blocks
* Finish lesson with De Morgan's law
  * Describe De Morgan's law
  * Illustrate De Morgan's law
  * Show some code running that shows understanding
  * Resources, it is really time to show you can find resources beyond the Teacher
  * Code/Code/Coding is everywhere, find something that helps

-----

## Week 2 - 8/30 Notes

* Java can create objects with..
  * Scanner Class - inputs/outputs
  * System Class - output to console using static method ```System.out.printf()```
  * Math Class - call a static method ```Math.random()```
* Other College Board Topics:
* 2D Array to store colors
  * x --> color; y --> color code
* Control Structure - used to process a Menu

### Front-end

* Fastpages is front-end
  * Runs in browser
  * HTML & CSS
  * No server to run on
* GitHub Pages are also front-end
* ***Find a theme that works other than Minima on fastpages***
* Challenge: take Liquid/JavaScript and see if you can build Mr. M's schedule
* Do a time-box of your own schedule

### Human Day 1

* must do for review (or else -0.25 to score)
  * review score at top of review ticket
  * link to fastpages
  * tickets are with 4 person group

-----

## Week 1 - 8/23 Notes

* Python - weakly type language
* Java - strongly type language

* In Java, you have to declare data types
* In Python it automatically changes data types
* Java is OOP

* Primitive Data Types
  * Boolean
  * Character
  * Integer
  * Double/Float
  * Long
  * Short
  *

* Non-Primitive: (classes)
  * String
  * Array
  * etc.

* Wrapper class - contains methods (functions)

* Opening notebook - vs code > apcsa repo > notebooks directory
